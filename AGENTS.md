# Agent Context

## Project Status

This is a greenfield project and has not been released.

- Do not optimize for backward compatibility.
- Do not preserve workarounds unless they still make clear architectural sense.
- Prefer clean, sweeping refactors over incremental patching when that improves the codebase.
- It is fine to reshape APIs, folder structure, and internal architecture when needed.
- Keep the code simple and readable.
- Ensure maximum type safety.
- Always leave the codebase better than you found it.

## Dependency Source

This repo keeps fetched dependency source code in `opensrc/` for local agent context.

- Check `opensrc/sources.json` for the current fetched package list.
- Use those local sources when behavior is unclear from types alone.
- Do not commit files from `opensrc/`; the directory is intentionally gitignored.

## Worktrees And Sandboxes

When working from a linked git worktree, prefer the sandbox workflow over the host-level dev scripts.

- Use `pnpm sandbox:up` to boot app, api, and Postgres for the current worktree.
- Use `pnpm sandbox:status` or `pnpm sandbox:url` to discover the current worktree's endpoints.
- Use `pnpm sandbox:logs` when debugging sandboxed services.
- Use `pnpm sandbox:down` when you are finished with that worktree's sandbox.
- Prefer the sandbox URLs and `portless` aliases for worktree development. Fall back to the loopback URLs printed by the CLI when aliases are unavailable.
- Do not default to `pnpm dev` inside linked worktrees unless the user explicitly asks for the non-sandbox flow.
