# Documentation Index

This directory documents the current Ceird codebase. The `architecture` guides
describe how the major systems fit together; `superpowers/specs` and
`superpowers/plans` preserve historical design and implementation context.

## Start Here

- [Development Workflow](development.md) explains install, local dev,
  testing, formatting, migrations, and deployment commands.
- [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md) maps the monorepo,
  runtime services, request flow, data flow, and code ownership boundaries.
- [Frontend Architecture](architecture/frontend.md) explains the TanStack Start
  app, routes, feature folders, hotkeys, auth bridge, and UI testing approach.
- [API Architecture](architecture/api.md) explains the Effect API, Better Auth
  integration, MCP resource server, jobs domain, database schema, errors, and
  Cloudflare Worker.
- [Shared Packages](architecture/packages.md) explains each package under
  `packages/` and what code belongs there.
- [Local Development And Infrastructure](architecture/sandbox-and-infra.md)
  explains Alchemy stages, local environment setup, the root Alchemy stack, and
  production infrastructure.

## Historical Specs And Plans

`docs/superpowers/specs` contains feature design specs. `docs/superpowers/plans`
contains implementation plans that were written before or during feature work.
Use these documents for intent and decision history, but verify current behavior
against source code before treating them as authoritative.

`docs/superpowers/progress` contains living progress notes for long-running
agent goals, including feature exploration, design direction, implementation
status, and validation notes that should be updated on each run.

## Documentation Maintenance

When code changes affect a boundary, update the matching guide in the same
change:

- Routes, UI architecture, hotkeys, or client/server data loading:
  `architecture/frontend.md`
- API endpoints, MCP resource server behavior, services, repositories, auth
  behavior, migrations, or runtime configuration: `architecture/api.md`
- Shared schemas, DTOs, IDs, errors, or package ownership:
  `architecture/packages.md`
- Alchemy stages, local environment setup, or deploy infrastructure:
  `architecture/sandbox-and-infra.md`
- Cross-system behavior or workspace layout: `architecture/system-overview.md`

Prefer short, source-backed updates over broad rewrite notes. Link to exact code
paths when a reader will need implementation details.
