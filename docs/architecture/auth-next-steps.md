# Authentication Extension Rules

This document is the companion to `docs/architecture/auth.md`.

`auth.md` describes how authentication works today.

This file describes how future authentication work should fit into the current
architecture without drifting into ad hoc wrappers or mixed concerns.

## How To Read This Document

This is not a promise of exact product roadmap order.

It is a set of architectural default rules:

- what kinds of auth work should come next
- where each kind of auth feature should live
- what we should preserve from the current design
- what changes would count as architectural drift

If product priorities change, the sequence can change. The fit rules should stay
stable unless we intentionally redesign auth.

## Core Extension Principle

Future auth work should preserve the current shape unless there is a strong
reason to change it:

1. Better Auth remains the source of truth for auth behavior.
2. `apps/api` continues to own auth runtime, persistence, and HTTP contract.
3. `apps/app` continues to own UI, routing, and session-aware UX.
4. App-specific wrappers should be added only when they remove real friction
   that the native Better Auth shape cannot reasonably handle on its own.

The default move is to extend the existing auth slice, not to invent a parallel
auth system.

## Default Planning Assumptions

Without extra product input, the safest default order is:

1. complete core account lifecycle flows
2. improve trust and recovery flows
3. add product-specific identity structure
4. add authorization only when the domain model requires it
5. add convenience wrappers only after repeated pain is visible

Translated to likely auth milestones:

1. transactional auth email polish on the shared delivery boundary
2. organization or workspace-aware identity, if the product needs it
3. role and permission checks
4. social auth
5. app-facing viewer/session convenience helpers, only if still needed

That is a recommendation, not a hidden roadmap commitment.

## Non-Negotiable Rules For Future Work

These rules should hold unless we explicitly decide to replace the current
architecture.

### Keep Better Auth Native

We should continue to:

- use Better Auth endpoints directly
- use Better Auth client methods directly
- configure new auth capabilities in the existing auth slice first

We should avoid:

- creating duplicate custom auth endpoints that merely rename Better Auth
  behavior
- wrapping every Better Auth call in a custom service without a concrete need
- reshaping auth into app-specific abstractions too early

### Keep Auth Boundary Ownership Clear

Backend auth concerns belong in `apps/api`:

- provider configuration
- session behavior
- cookies
- auth persistence
- transactional auth policy
- auth-oriented rate limiting
- trusted origins and cross-origin rules

Frontend auth concerns belong in `apps/app`:

- screens
- route gating
- submit UX
- error presentation
- post-auth navigation
- authenticated shell behavior

Do not move policy into the app just because the UI is the first place it shows
up.

### Keep Route Semantics Simple

The current route split should remain the default:

- login and signup stay guest-only
- recovery routes may stay public outside the authenticated shell
- product routes stay inside the authenticated app boundary

Until there is a compelling reason otherwise:

- account entry and recovery screens belong outside `/_app`
- post-login onboarding belongs inside the authenticated boundary
- route guards stay centralized, not copied into page components

### Preserve Fail-Closed / Fail-Open Behavior

Current auth routing has a deliberate asymmetry:

- protected routes fail closed
- guest-only entry routes fail open
- public recovery routes stay reachable regardless of session state

Future auth screens and guards should preserve that intent:

- if a protected auth-dependent route cannot establish session state, redirect
  or block safely
- if a guest-only page cannot determine session state, prefer letting the user
  reach the auth UI
- if a signed-in user opens a public recovery route, prefer leaving that route
  reachable unless product policy changes explicitly

### Keep Redirect Logic Predictable

Current redirects are intentionally simple and fixed.

Do not add redirect-back or arbitrary return URL behavior casually.

If redirect-back is ever introduced, it should be an explicit architectural
change with:

- validation rules
- open-redirect protections
- documented route semantics

Not a one-off route-level convenience.

## Where Future Features Should Live

### Password Reset

Password reset is now part of the current architecture and sets the default
pattern for future recovery work.

It fits like this today:

- Better Auth retains native ownership of
  `/api/auth/request-password-reset` and `/api/auth/reset-password`
- `apps/api` owns email delivery policy through the narrow `AuthEmailSender`
  boundary
- `CloudflareAuthEmailTransport` is the current provider adapter behind that
  boundary
- public reset-request and reset-complete routes in `apps/app`
- the same form architecture already used across the guest auth surface
- generic reset-request responses that do not enumerate accounts
- the search-param-driven invalid-link state may specifically call out invalid
  or expired links
- submitted reset failures stay on the generic reset failure path

Rules:

- treat reset as a public auth flow, not an authenticated in-app flow
- keep reset pages outside `/_app`
- keep reset pages public even for already authenticated users unless product
  policy changes explicitly
- keep Better Auth native instead of replacing reset endpoints with app-owned
  HTTP wrappers
- prefer generic success messaging where enumeration risk exists
- reuse the existing validation and error-handling style

### Email Verification

Email verification is already part of the current architecture and uses the
same delivery boundary that password reset introduced.

It fits like this today:

- verification is link-based and the verification mail is delivered through
  `AuthEmailSender`
- the verification callback lands on the public `/verify-email` result route
  outside `/_app`
- verification does not block app access; the authenticated shell stays usable
  while `session.user.emailVerified` is false
- the authenticated shell shows a resend reminder until verification completes
- resend requests stay inside the app shell and use the current session email
  plus a `/verify-email` callback URL

Rules:

- keep verification public and link-based rather than inventing a second flow
- do not turn unverified email into a hard gate without a deliberate route
  policy change
- keep verification messaging safe, specific, and task-focused

### Transactional Auth Email

Auth email is shared infrastructure, not a screen-level detail.

Password reset already established the first version of this boundary in
`apps/api` with `AuthEmailSender` plus `CloudflareAuthEmailTransport`.

That boundary now contributes runtime config at auth startup:

- `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM`
- `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM_NAME`, which defaults to `"Task Tracker"`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

Because `AuthenticationLive` composes the auth email layer at boot, auth
startup now depends on valid email-boundary config as well as the core Better
Auth config.

Future auth mail such as email verification and organization invitations
should extend that same boundary, not create parallel delivery paths. The
`deliveryKey` field stays provider-neutral so auth mail can share the same
transport contract without leaking provider-specific naming into the domain
model.

Rules:

- keep email sending policy close to auth configuration
- do not couple email delivery to a specific page component
- treat reset and verification mail as one auth-email concern, not separate
  mini-systems

### Social Auth

Social auth is additive identity surface, not a replacement for the current
model.

It should fit like this:

- provider configuration in the existing Better Auth backend slice
- provider buttons and callback UX in public auth routes
- the same session and protected-shell model after success

Rules:

- add providers only for product reasons, not because the library supports them
- keep provider-specific complexity inside auth configuration, not scattered
  through app routes
- do not let social auth force a second routing model for the app shell

### Organizations, Workspaces, Membership

If the product becomes multi-tenant, organization membership belongs after core
account flows are stable.

It should fit like this:

- identity remains authentication
- org membership becomes an authenticated domain concern layered on top
- onboarding into an organization happens after sign-in, inside the protected
  app boundary

Rules:

- do not treat organization onboarding as a public auth flow by default
- separate "can sign in" from "has completed workspace setup"
- keep organization state out of the core auth contract unless Better Auth
  requires it

### Roles and Permissions

Authorization is a later layer than authentication.

When roles and permissions arrive:

- keep authentication checks and authorization checks conceptually separate
- do not overload `requireAuthenticatedSession()` with permission logic
- introduce role or permission checks at route or domain boundaries with clear
  names and explicit intent

Rules:

- auth answers "who is this?"
- authorization answers "what may they do?"
- do not collapse those into one generic helper unless the helper stays
  extremely explicit

### Viewer / Session Convenience Helpers

App-facing helpers such as `/me`, `/viewer`, or richer session facades should be
treated as optional conveniences, not a default step.

They become justified only if one of these is true:

- the native Better Auth session shape causes repeated duplication
- multiple app surfaces need the same derived identity payload
- product logic needs app-owned composition beyond raw auth session data

Rules:

- add these only in response to repeated pain, not speculative neatness
- keep them thin and purpose-driven
- do not use them to shadow or replace Better Auth's own session contract

## What Would Count As Drift

These are warning signs that future auth work is moving away from the intended
architecture.

- adding custom auth endpoints that mostly proxy Better Auth
- moving auth policy into random UI components
- mixing organization, permission, and authentication rules into one helper
- adding redirect logic independently in multiple routes
- introducing separate session stores for app convenience
- treating every new auth capability as grounds for a new abstraction layer
- making guest flows and authenticated flows share the same shell without a
  clear reason

If a change pushes in one of these directions, stop and re-evaluate before
continuing.

## Questions To Ask Before Adding A New Auth Capability

Before implementing any new auth feature, we should be able to answer:

1. Is this authentication, recovery, onboarding, or authorization?
2. Does it belong in the public auth area or the protected app area?
3. Can Better Auth already do the core behavior natively?
4. What user state changes after success?
5. Should failures fail closed or fail open?
6. Does this require new rate limits, email, or origin policy?
7. Are we introducing a real abstraction, or only hiding the native contract?

If those answers are fuzzy, the design is probably still too fuzzy.

## Default Recommendation For The Next Auth Docs Or Tasks

If we continue extending auth soon, the highest-value next documents or
implementation tracks are:

1. transactional auth email polish on the shared delivery boundary
2. organization-aware auth boundaries, if the product is heading multi-tenant
3. role and permission checks

Those are the places where architectural clarity is most likely to matter next.
