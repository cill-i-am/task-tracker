# Cloudflare Alchemy Mainline CI

Ceird deploys the Cloudflare POC through Alchemy v2. The stack uses
`Cloudflare.state({ workerName: "ceird-alchemy-state" })`, so CI and
local deploys share state through Cloudflare rather than through checked-in
`.alchemy` files.

This repository is not using per-PR preview infrastructure. The deploy workflow
applies changes to the single shared live Cloudflare stack after `main` passes
the `Build` workflow.

## Alchemy Stage

Alchemy has its own CLI stage in addition to the application naming stage loaded
from `CEIRD_INFRA_STAGE`. Both must be stable in CI.

For the mainline deployment:

- `ALCHEMY_STAGE=main`
- `CEIRD_ALCHEMY_STAGE=main`
- `CEIRD_INFRA_STAGE=production`

The `packages/infra/scripts/alchemy-env.mjs` wrapper injects `--stage` from
those environment variables when the caller does not pass one explicitly. This
prevents GitHub Actions from falling back to Alchemy's default
`dev_${USER}` stage, which would create a separate state namespace on every
runner.

The current live resource names are intended to be `ceird-production-*`. The
original local POC used `task-tracker-preview-*` under the local
`dev_cillianbarron` Alchemy stage; those resources should be destroyed before
the first `ceird-production` deploy, rather than adopted into CI.

## GitHub Secrets And Variables

Create a GitHub environment named `main` and add:

Secrets:

- `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN_ID`

Variables:

- `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM_NAME`
- `PLANETSCALE_ORGANIZATION`

`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` must be able to read and update the Cloudflare state
store, deploy Workers, manage custom domains, queues, Hyperdrive, and bind
Cloudflare Email Service to the API Worker. Alchemy's CI guide specifically calls out that
`Cloudflare.state()` needs Cloudflare Secrets Store Write in CI because Alchemy
reads the state-store token back through an ephemeral edge-preview Worker with a
secret binding.

## Workflow

`.github/workflows/deploy-main.yml` deploys on:

- successful `Build` workflow runs on `main`
- manual `workflow_dispatch`

The workflow:

- installs dependencies with pnpm
- type-checks the app and infra package
- deploys through `pnpm --filter @task-tracker/infra run deploy`
- serializes deploys with a GitHub Actions concurrency group
- applies migrations by default through `APPLY_MIGRATIONS=true`

Use the manual `apply_migrations=false` input only when intentionally testing a
deploy that must not touch the database schema.

## Alchemy Docs Notes

The Alchemy v2 CI guide recommends:

- using `state: Cloudflare.state()` for Cloudflare-backed state
- using GitHub Actions secrets/variables for CI credentials
- setting an explicit stage with `alchemy deploy --stage <stage>`
- optionally using `--adopt` when importing existing cloud resources into a
  fresh state store

The guide also describes a more advanced `stacks/github.ts` approach where
Alchemy creates scoped provider credentials and writes them into GitHub. We are
not adding that yet; for this POC, manually managed GitHub environment secrets
are simpler and avoid giving the stack token-management authority until we
decide the deployment model is worth keeping.
