| `src/cloudflare-stack.ts` | Cloudflare app, API, queues, email bindings, Hyperdrive binding, and observability. |
| `src/neon.ts`             | Native Neon project/branch layout and resource creation.                            |

## Deployed Resources

The stack provisions a native Alchemy Neon project for the parent stage, a
per-stage Neon branch that applies the checked-in API SQL migrations, native
Alchemy Cloudflare Hyperdrive backed by that branch, a Cloudflare Worker API, a
Cloudflare Vite app, auth email queues, and the Cloudflare Email Worker binding
used by deployed auth email delivery.

Hyperdrive is configured with a conservative origin connection limit and reads
its origin directly from the typed Neon branch output.

See [../../docs/architecture/sandbox-and-infra.md](../../docs/architecture/sandbox-and-infra.md)
for configuration variables and deployment flow.
